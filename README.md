# Midterm-Lab-Task-3
Using Excel, this portfolio demonstrates how to create an interactive Data Science Salary & Job Trends Dashboard. Through the use of pivot tables, charts, slicers, and an optional map for visualization, it examines employment trends by industry, pays by role, and firm size.

## Step 1: Use the given data
* Open the Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the Transform Tables:
* Sal By Role
* Sal By State
* Sal By Size

## Step 2: Design the dashboard to highlight the following:
* State with the most Data Science jobs
* Job role with the highest average salary
* Company size that pays the highest salary
* Sector with the lowest & highest number of Data Science jobs
* Sector with the minimum & maximum average salary

## Step 3: Create a pivot table
* Use pivot tables to summarize data for sector jobs and salary (d & e)

## Step 4: Generate charts for reports
* Use bar, column, or pie charts to visualize salary trends and job distribution

## Step 5: Insert slicers for filtering
* Add slicers for role type, company size, and state to make the dashboard interactive

## Step 6: Add a map (optional)
* If available in your Excel version, insert a map visualization to show job distribution by state

## Step 7: Apply design & formatting
* Customize the colors, fonts, and layout to make the dashboard visually appealing

## Step 8: Complete the dashboard
* Ensure all required visuals and reports are included
* The slicers should be functional and interactive
